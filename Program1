Aim: To implement Array Operations.
Program: Write a program to implement Array Operations and perform the tasks of traversal, insertion, deletion and searching and execute them with provided test cases.
•	Test with input array [5,3,8,1,9] insert 7 at 2, delete index 1, search 8, update index 3 to value 4. 
Description: In this lab we have focused on developing a code for array implementation for the above tasks. For each and every task we have created a set of methods which we call according to the function and acquire required outputs. 
Code:



# Simple Python Program for Array Operations

# Step 1: Take list input from user
arr = list(map(int, input("Enter list elements (space separated): ").split()))
print("Original List:", arr)

# Step 2: Traverse the list
print("\nList elements are:")
for num in arr:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()

# Step 3: Insert element
pos = int(input("\nEnter index to insert: "))
val = int(input("Enter value to insert: "))
arr = arr[:pos] + [val] + arr[pos:]
print("List after insertion:", arr)

# Step 4: Delete element
pos = int(input("\nEnter index to delete: "))
if 0 <= pos < len(arr):
    arr = arr[:pos] + arr[pos+1:]
    print("List after deletion:", arr)
else:
    print("Invalid index!")

# Step 5: Search element
val = int(input("\nEnter value to search: "))
found = -1
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] == val:
        found = i
        break
if found != -1:
    print("Element found at index:", found)
else:
    print("Element not found!")

# Step 6: Update element
pos = int(input("\nEnter index to update: "))
val = int(input("Enter new value: "))
if 0 <= pos < len(arr):
    arr[pos] = val
    print("List after updating:", arr)
else:
    print("Invalid index!")
# Step 7: Final output
print("\nFinal List:", arr)
