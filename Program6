Aim: To implement Heap and Priority Queue.
Program: Write a Program to implement heap based  Priority Queues using Min Heap with operations like Insert, Extract-Min, Heapify(use heapq optionally)
	Test With:
	[4, 30, 3, 25, 16, 9].
Description:
1. Min-Heap Implementation
This program implements a Min-Heap data structure in Pyhton using an ArrayList, where the parent node is always smaller than its children. The MinHeap class provides:
•	Insert: Adds elements at the end and performs heapify-up to maintain heap property
•	Extract-Min: Removes the root (minimum element), replaces it with the last element, and performs heapify-down
•	Heapify: Maintains min-heap property by swapping elements to ensure parents are smaller than children
The program is tested by inserting [4, 30, 3, 25, 16, 9], resulting in a heap structure with 3 at the root.
2. Heapsort Using Min-Heap
This program implements Heapsort in Python using the min-heap structure to sort arrays in ascending order. The algorithm:
•	Builds a min-heap: Inserts all array elements into the heap
•	Extracts elements: Repeatedly removes the minimum element to build the sorted array
•	Time complexity: O(n log n) for both building and extracting
Testing with [4, 30, 3, 25, 16, 9] produces the sorted array [3, 4, 9, 16, 25, 30].
Code:
import heapq
print("P.Manoj cse-c 24241")

def insert_into_heap(heap):
    val = int(input("Enter value to insert: "))
    heapq.heappush(heap, val)
    print("Inserted successfully!\n")

def extract_min(heap):
    if heap:
        print("Minimum element removed:", heapq.heappop(heap))
    else:
        print("Heap is empty!\n")

def display_heap(heap):
    print("Current Min-Heap:", heap, "\n")

def heap_sort():
    n = int(input("Enter number of elements to sort: "))
    arr = []
    for i in range(n):
        val = int(input(f"Enter element {i+1}: "))
        arr.append(val)

    heapq.heapify(arr)  # convert to heap
    sorted_list = []
    while arr:
        sorted_list.append(heapq.heappop(arr))

    print("Sorted list (Heap Sort):", sorted_list, "\n")

# Main program starts here

heap = []

while True:
    print("===== MENU =====")
    print("1. Insert into Min-Heap")
    print("2. Extract Minimum")
    print("3. Display Heap")
    print("4. Heap Sort")
    print("5. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")

    if choice == '1':
        insert_into_heap(heap)
    elif choice == '2':
        extract_min(heap)
    elif choice == '3':
        display_heap(heap)
    elif choice == '4':
        heap_sort()
    elif choice == '5':
        print("Exiting program...")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Please enter 1–5.\n")
